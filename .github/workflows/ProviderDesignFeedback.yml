# Create/Edit OpenAPI Document in SwaggerHub or store OpenAPI document locally in env.oas_file_location below
# Sync OpenAPI -> SCM with Github Sync - https://support.smartbear.com/swaggerhub/docs/integrations/github-sync.html
# Version number = <OAS Version>-<GitHub Commit SHA>-design
# OpenAPI + Provider Test Report = Provider Contract Uploaded to PactFlow
# *** Test Report is just OAS file, as the design will not be tested against an API mock or real implementation at this stage ***
# PactFlow compares OpenAPI against any registered consumers
# Visiblity into affected consumers visible via can-i-deploy
